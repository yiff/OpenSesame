# OpenSesame
a GUI wrapper for Infinias Access Control's RESTful API. Let's you add/remove buttons to a simple GUI for opening doors. Written in Python 3.8.10.

I used GooeyPie for the GUI module. PyInstaller is the thing that I used to compile the Python script into a single-file .exe. If you want to play with the script as a .py file, you'll need to uncomment and comment the appropriate sections in the updateGUI() function.
